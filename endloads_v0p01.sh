############################################################################################################################################################################
#  The Endwall development team would like to acknowledge the work and efforts
#  of Odilitime, who graciously hosted and promoted this firewall project.
#  Without his efforts and his wonderful website www.endchan.xyz , endwall.sh would not
#  exist in the public domain at all in any form. So thanks to Odilitime for inspiring this work
#  and for hosting and promoting it. 
#  
#  Endwall,Endsets,Endlists, and Endtools are named in honor of Endchan.
#
#  Thank you also to early beta testers including a@a, and to other contributors 
#  as well as to the detractors who helped to critique this work and to ultimately improve it.  
#  
#  We also acknowledge paste.debian.net and gitweb for their hosting services, 
#  without which distribution would be limited / impossible, so thank you.
#
#  https://www.endchan.xyz, http://paste.debian.net, http://gitweb2zl5eh7tp3.onion  
#
#  We salute you! 
#  
#  In the end, may it all end well.
